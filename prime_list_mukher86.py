Assignment: 4.2.5. Prime List
Date: 09/20/2024

Description:
The program defines a function is_prime() to determine whether a given number is prime. 
It checks for divisibility starting from 2 up to the square root of the number. 
If the number is divisible by any number in this range, it's not prime; otherwise, it is.
The program then lists all the prime from 2 upto a specific limit defined by the user's
input.

        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
