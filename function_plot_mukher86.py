Assignment: 10.2.4. Function plot
Date: 10/28/2024

Description:
This Python program uses `matplotlib` to plot two trigonometric sine and cosine functions, 
 over the range 0 to 2pi with labeled axes, custom ticks, and a legend. 
 Then the plot is saved as a PDF with specified visual adjustments to spines and colors.

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.
