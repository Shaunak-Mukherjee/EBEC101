Assignment:10.2.1. Monthly Sales
Date: 10/28/2024

Description:
This Python program collects monthly sales data from the user, stores it, and visualizes the data 
as a pie chart using Purdueâ€™s secondary color palette. The chart displays each month as a labeled 
slice, with percentages shown, and saves the output as a PDF file.

    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.
