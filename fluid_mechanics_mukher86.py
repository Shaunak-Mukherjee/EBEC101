Assignment: 2.2.5. Fluid Mechanics
Date: 09/05/2024

Description:
This simple python program asks the user to enter a number in seconds 
and displays the time entered in days, hours, minutes and seconds so 
it can be a neat time calculator.

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [x] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.

    source, either modified or unmodified; nor have I provided
    another student access to my code.  The project I am
