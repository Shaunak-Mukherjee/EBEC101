Assignment: 11.2.5. User Privileges

Description:
The program defines two classes: Privileges, which manages a set of user privileges, 
and User, which stores user information and interacts with the Privileges class.

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.
